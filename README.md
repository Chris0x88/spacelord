**Pacman** is a lightweight, AI-native trading CLI primitive for the Hedera network. It handles the "spectral" complexity of HTS token variants, proactive associations, and high-accuracy price discovery so that your agents—and you—can trade effortlessly.

---

## 🌪️ Features

- **Natural Language Execution**: Swap, convert, and send using intuitive commands: `swap 10 HBAR for USDC`.
- **Intelligent Variant Routing**: Automatically discovers the optimal path through HTS and ERC20-wrapped variants.
- **Proactive Association**: Pacman detects missing token associations and initializes them on-chain automatically.
- **Multi-Tier Price Discovery**: Aggregates live data from SaucerSwap V2, CoinGecko, and Binance.
- **AI-Agent Ready**: Built as a primitive for agentic infrastructures (OpenClaw, AutoGPT, etc.) with detailed logging and low-latency startup.
- **Security First**: Mandatory transaction simulations and local private key management.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
Clone the repository and run the auto-installer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chris0x88/pacman.git
cd pacman
./pacman  # This will auto-initialize the venv and dependencies
```

### 2. Configuration (Onboarding)
Once the CLI starts, Pacman will guide you through the setup:
1.  **Wallet Setup**: Run `setup` to securely enter your Account ID and Private Key (masked input).
2.  **API Key**: Set your SaucerSwap API key when prompted for high-accuracy pricing.
3.  **Bootstrap Liquidity**: Run `pools search USDC` and `pools approve <ID>` to whitelist your first trading pairs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Modular Discovery**: Pacman does not ship with a bloated pool list. You must "Approve" the pools you want to trade in to keep your routing engine fast and curated.

## 👤 Interactive Console

## 🤖 For AI Developers

Pacman is designed to be "Consumed" by AI agents. Every command generates structured terminal output that is easy for LLMs to parse, and detailed execution logs are stored in `logs/` for strategy auditing.

## 🛡️ Security & Guardrails

- **Simulation Mode**: Set `PACMAN_SIMULATE=true` in `.env` to test routes without broadcasting live transactions.
- **Local Keys Only**: Your private keys never leave your machine.
- **Slippage Protection**: Hard-capped slippage limits prevent execution during extreme volatility.
